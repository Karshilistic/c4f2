# TO-DO
- [ ] Design test cases
    * Competition tests for 24 different test cases. Must ensure our agent performs well in a number of varied situations
    * Edge cases are important, some ideas:
        * Flow from only 1 direction
        * Flow from 2 directions on the same axis
        * Flow from 2 directions on different axis
        * Very heavy traffic
        * Light traffic
        * Heavy traffic in one direction, light in the other

- [ ] Decide on framework, type of agent, hyperparameters, etc
    * Suggested type according to reasearch: Deep Q-learning Network
